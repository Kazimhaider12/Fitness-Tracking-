Suggestions for Enhancement (if you're building or refining this in Power BI)
Since you're skilled in dashboard design, here are a few ideas:
Use slicers for filtering by activity type (e.g., cardio vs. strength).
Add tooltips to charts for richer insights on hover.
Incorporate KPIs with conditional formatting to highlight goals met.
Create summary cards for quick-glance metrics like total steps, average heart rate, etc.
